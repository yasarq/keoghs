Checkout kata

Items are priced individually. In addition, there are promotions which can affect the total price of the basket, for example, when 3 lots of item ‘D’ are added to the basket then a 25% deduction is applied to the total cost of 2 of those items. The pricing changes frequently, so pricing should be independent of the checkout.


This is not the best of possible approach.

Most of testing scenarios are in test project.

I started with a different and lengthy approach but this time keeping things simple as possible.
